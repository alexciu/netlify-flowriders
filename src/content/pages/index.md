My name is Alin Lupu, i live in Brasov and i've always been passionate about adrenaline (snowboard, mountainboard, downhill, rock climbing, skydiving).  

I've been snowboarding since 2007, and in 2009 I became an ISIA certified snowboard instructor. In 2016 I started the first mountainboarding school in Romania.
